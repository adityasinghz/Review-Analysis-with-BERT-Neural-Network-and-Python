# Review-Analysis-with-BERT-Neural-Network-and-Python
Nowadays almost all companies are working on Review Based Project Management techniques, So user reviews play a very crucial role in such a scenario so this model is able to rate each review on a scale of 1 to 5.  BERT already have a pre-trained dataset of 6 different languages for this project, which made this model easier to develop. Then used BeautifulSoup for scaping useful data from the web page(HTML page), but the comments were in the class of the HTML page, so to extract it regex is used then used pandas data frames for output.
